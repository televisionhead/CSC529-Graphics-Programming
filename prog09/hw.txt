1. Set the texture coordinates correctly in Sphere.js.  The mandrill
   should be upright and looking to the left.  Once you have it right,
   switch the first image (tex1) to moon_diffuse.jpg.  You should now
   see a picture of the moon pasted on the sphere.

2. In sphere.html, calculate ux, uy, and uz for the tangent frame from
   the (interpolated) vectors fNormal and fTangent.  If you click
   useNormal, you should see a shiny grey sphere.

3. Set kd and ks from tex1 and tex2 using texture coordinate fTCoord.
   Clicking once once on useNormal should show shaded but smooth moon.

4. Look up the normal_color (encoding of normal as a color) in tex3
   using fTCoord.  Set n_ts (normal in tangent space) to decoded
   normal.  The moon should pop!

5. By adding or subtracting dx or dy to tcoord and using this texture
   coordinate in the height map tex4, set offset.x and offset.y.
   Clicking NormalHeight twice should now show a bumpy grey sphere.
   Use the bump slider to make the bumps higher.
