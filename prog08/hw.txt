1. Modify Picture.js to set this.picture2world and this.world2picture
   to their correct values.

   Set picture2clip in render in view.js.  We use picture2clip instead
   of model2clip for the picture.

   The mandrill should appear rightside up on a large square.


2. Uncomment out the call to sphere render in view.js.  You should see
   the sphere painted with mandrills.

   Just before this call, pass model2picture into the fragment shader.

   In the shader (EXERCISE 2B), calculate (vec4) pP and rP
   that are p and r in Picture coordinates.

   Calculate where pP + s rP hits the plane of the picture (z=0).

   If it hits the picture, add the PRODUCT of the colors in tex1 and
   tex2 to the fragment color.

   What this should look like is an "invisible sphere" which shows the
   invisible tatoo.  (Make sure you are using the perspective view and
   you clicked FlatSmooth once.)


3. Change the initialization of pictureRight in view.js so the
   picture on the right side instead, with the origin at (1,1,-1) and the
   picture coming towards you.  Use the RightBack button to select it.

   You have to switch to perspective to see it because it will be
   coming at you.


4. Change the calculation of r in the fragment shader to use the
   mirror rule.  The sphere should reflect the picture (after you
   click flat/round at least once.)


5. If refract==1 use the calculation of r for diamond instead.
