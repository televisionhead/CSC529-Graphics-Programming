EXERCISE 1 (TWO LOCATIONS IN THE FILE!)
This is not the perspective projection using a and b.  Instead it is
an orthographic projection.  It takes x to x, y to y, z=-near to z=-1
and z=-far to z=1.  It is a combination of a translation and a scale
matrix.  Make sure your view2proj takes (1, 1, -2) to (1, 1, -1) and
(1, 1, -10) to (1, 1, 1).  Check the printouts to the console.

This transformation is not in the notes.  You already learned how to
do this (for which transformation?).

Since we are moving the cube to (0, 0, -3), three units away from the
eye, how does its appearance change?  (Hint: trick question.)


EXERCISE 2
We are moving the eye/camera now, not the object.  Since we are moving
the eye, which way will ultimately cause the front of the object to
hit the near plane and how many clicks?  Same question for rear plane?


EXERCISE 3
Similar.  Just remember the theory of relativity!


EXERCISE 4
It should be pretty obvious what "look at" should look like when you
click it.  If you drag the object to the side or upper left or
something, you are looking at it along a diagonal.  So when you look
at it, it is farther away.  Eventually, it will disappear past the far
plane unless you adjust with the vz+0.1 or vz-0.1 button (which one?).


EXERCISE 5
We all know what zooming looks like.


EXERCISE 6
NOW do the perspective transformation.  Click OrthPers to test it.


EXERCISE 7 (TWO LOCATIONS IN THE FILE)
Until you do this exercise, dragging won't work quite right because you
are dragging in front of or behind the object so perspective scale is
wrong.
